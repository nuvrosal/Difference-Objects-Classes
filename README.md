Objects and Classes
Object A value of a class type. An object is a self-contained unit containing data and methods to manipulate that data.
Think of an object as a real-world entity. For example, a car can be an object. It has data (color, model, speed) and methods (drive, brake, accelerate).
Classes programmer-defined data type. A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.
It defines what data the objects will hold and what methods they will have.
Example:
Car class would describe the properties (color, model, speed) and behaviors (drive, brake, accelerate) that all car objects will have.
Class: Car
Properties: color, model, speed
Methods: drive(), brake(), accelerate()

Object: MyCar (an instance of the Car class)
Data: color = "red", model = "Toyota", speed = 0
Methods: MyCar.drive(), MyCar.brake(), MyCar.accelerate()



An object is a self-contained unit containing data and methods to manipulate that data.
Think of an object as a real-world entity. For example, an employee can be an object. It has data (employee number, name, vacation days) and methods (work, takeVacation).
Classes:

A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.
It defines what data the objects will hold and what methods they will have.
An Employee class would describe the properties (employee number, name, vacation days) and behaviors (work, takeVacation) that all employee objects will have.

Employee Example:
Class: Employee
Properties: employeeNumber, name, vacationDays
Methods: work(), takeVacation()
Object: JohnDoe (an instance of the Employee class)
Data: employeeNumber = 12345, name = "John Doe", vacationDays = 15
Methods: JohnDoe.work(), JohnDoe.takeVacation()
